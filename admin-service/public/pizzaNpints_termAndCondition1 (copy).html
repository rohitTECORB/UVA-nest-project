                are both users of the Services provided by Pizza-N-Pints and are hereinafter referred to collectively as "Users."</p>
            <h3 class="mb-0">Fees and Payment</h3>
            <h2 class="mt-0">Fees</h2>
            <p>Fees for the Subscription ("Subscription Fees") are set forth (a) herein, (b) online and/or (c) in a separately executed or accepted Subscription agreement between you and Pizza-N-Pints. In addition to the Subscription Fees, Pizza-N-Pints charges a processing
                fee (indicated at time of charge) for appointments made using the Services. We reserve the right, upon notice to you, to change the amount of the processing fee.Â </p>
            <p>You agree to pay Pizza-N-Pints the Subscription Fees, and any other applicable fees as may be agreed to by you. All fees are non-refundable and non-transferable except for as expressly provided in these Terms of Service. Unless otherwise stated,
                fees must be paid in advance of each billing period.</p>
            <p>Each Professional authorizes us to confirm that the credit card account or other payment method associated with their Account and used in connection with the Services is and remains in good standing with a financial institution as long as
                the Professional is using the Services. Each Professional authorizes us to obtain credit reports or other background inquiries from time to time to assess the Professional's eligibility to continue use of the Services. All balances and
                all fees, charges, and payments collected or paid through the <strong>Services are denominated in Kr</strong>. Users of the Service will be liable for any taxes (including VAT, if applicable, required to be paid on the Services provided
                under the Agreement (other than taxes on the Company's income). Billing Cycle</p>
            <h3>Billing Cycle</h3>
            <p>Your Subscription starts on the date that you sign up for a Subscription and submit payment. Unless otherwise communicated to you at the time of sign up, each Subscription cycle is one-month in length ("Subscription Period"), and will automatically
                renew on a monthly basis until we terminate the Subscription, or you notify us via the Services or by email to cancelsubscription@Na-yee.com of your decision to terminate your current Subscription. Unless otherwise communicated to you,
                you will be billed on the monthly anniversary of first submitting payment to us for your Subscription (e.g., if your Subscription begins on July 25th, it will renew on August 25th, September 25th, and so on. If your Subscription begins
                on a date that doesn't occur every billing cycle (e.g., the 31st), you will be billed on the last day of every month. We reserve the right to change the timing of our billing. You acknowledge that the amount billed to you each month may
                vary due to promotional offers and/or adding or changing your Subscription plan, and you authorize Pizza-N-Pints to charge you for these varying amounts as necessary.</p>
            <h2>Subscription Pricing</h2>
            <p>We reserve the right to adjust pricing for the Subscription Services at any time upon fourteen (14) days prior notice. Unless we expressly communicate otherwise, any price change to your membership will take effect on your next billing cycle.
                You must agree to the change in fees to continue to use the Services. To withdraw your consent, you will need to cancel your account by logging into your account and following the cancellation procedures there, or notifying us at cancelsubscription@Na-yee.com</p>
            <h3>Trials</h3>
            <p>Pizza-N-Pints may, from time to time, offer trial memberships which include free or discounted access to the Subscription during the designated trial period. Each trial membership will automatically convert to a regular monthly subscription unless
                cancelled no more than forty-eight (48) hours prior to the end of your trial period. To cancel your subscription, logon to your account and follow the cancellation procedures indicated there, or email cancelsubscription@Na-yee.com.
            </p>
            <h3>Cancellation of your Subscription</h3>
            <p>You may terminate your Subscription at any time. If you cancel with more than forty-eight (48) hours notice prior to your next billing cycle, you will not be charged for the next month of the Subscription Service. If you have any questions
                about your individual billing cycle, please log onto your account to view your billing cycle details, or contact us at support@Na-yee.com.</p>
            <p>You will not be eligible for a prorated refund or any portion of the Subscription Fees paid for the then-current monthly subscription cycle. Following cancellation, you will continue to have access to the Subscription Services through the
                end of your current billing cycle.</p>
            <h2>Other fees</h2>
            <p>Pizza-N-Pints may from time to time, either as a Pizza-N-Pints Program (described in paragraph 7 below) or otherwise, provide certain services to Professionals and/or Clients for an additional fee that would help Professionals grow their business and enable
                Professionals and Clients to connect more easily. A description of such Pizza-N-Pints Programs in effect as of today is located atÂ </p>
            <h3>Pizza-N-Pints Platform</h3>
            <p>Pizza-N-Pints solely provides a platform for Professionals and Clients to connect and serves only as a medium to facilitate the provision of Styling Services. Pizza-N-Pints does not provide or contract for Styling Services, and Professionals and Clients
                contract independently for the provision of Styling Services. Each Client is solely responsible for selecting the Professional, the Styling Services to be provided and the location at which Styling Services will be performed, whether on
                the premises of a Professional or at a site designated by the Client. Any decision by a Client to receive Styling Services or by a Professional to provide Styling Services is a decision made in such person's sole discretion and at their
                own risk. All Users understand and acknowledge that (i) the Company does not conduct background checks on Clients and (ii) any provision of Services in a private location inherently increases the risks involved for both Clients, Professionals
                and any personnel of Professionals, as applicable. Each Professional must decide whether a Client is suited to such Professional's services and should exercise caution and common sense to protect the personal safety and property of such
                Professional and its personnel, as applicable, just as they would when interacting with anyone you don't know. NEITHER COMPANY NOR ITS AFFILIATES OR LICENSORS IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CONDUCT, WHETHER ONLINE OR OFFLINE, OF ANY USER OF THE
                SERVICES AND YOU HEREBY RELEASE THE COMPANY AND ITS AFFILIATES OR LICENSORS FROM ANY LIABILITY RELATED THERETO.Â COMPANY AND ITS AFFILIATES AND LICENSORS WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, INJURY OR DAMAGE ARISING IN CONNECTION WITH YOUR
                USE OF THE SERVICES.</p>
            <p>Pizza-N-Pints does not have control over the quality, suitability, reliability, timing, durability, legality, failure to provide, or any other aspect whatsoever of any Styling Services provided by Professionals nor of the integrity, responsibility
                or any of the actions or omissions whatsoever of any Professionals or Clients. Pizza-N-Pints makes no representations or warranties whatsoever with respect to Styling Services offered or provided by Professionals or requested by Clients through
                use of the Services, whether in public, private, or offline interactions, or about the accreditation, registration or licensing of any Professional. You understand that Pizza-N-Pints does not routinely screen its Users, inquire into the background
                of its Users or attempt to verify information provided by any User. Pizza-N-Pints does not verify or confirm that any User is who they claim to be or is accurately representing themselves and does not verify or confirm any representations with
                respect to Styling Services on the Services. Pizza-N-Pints does not assume any responsibility for the accuracy or reliability of this information or any information provided through the Services. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Pizza-N-Pints may, but
                is not obligated to, check the background and experience of Professionals via third-party background check services and first party interviews, including but not limited to a verification of identity and a comprehensive criminal background
                check and may terminate a Professional based on any information discovered during such background checks and first party interviews.</p>
            <p><strong>In connection with certain services, including Styling Services, for which reservations are made available on the Services, if approved by Pizza-N-Pints, you may require Clients to enter credit card or other payment information, and at your discretion, you may charge fees for reservations, including cancelled and missed appointments, only in accordance with any policy posted on your Pizza-N-Pints page at the time of the Client's booking. While Pizza-N-Pints takes what it believes to be reasonable efforts to ensure secure transmission of your information to third parties who assess and process payments, Pizza-N-Pints is not responsible for any fees or charges assessed by third parties or any errors in the processing of payments by third parties, including any errors that result from third-party negligence, improper transmission of payment information, a Client's mistaken submission of payment information or submission of erroneous payment information. If you manually insert a Clientâs credit card information and save it to such Clientâs account, you represent that you have permission from each Client to save such Clientâs credit card information, you take full responsibility for adhering to each Clientâs preferences with respect to such credit card information and hereby agree to indemnify us for any claims arising out of failure to obtain such permission.</strong></p>
            <p><strong>You agree and represent that you will honor the reservations made by Clients through the Services, or will communicate with them in advance to resolve any scheduling conflicts to the Client's and Pizza-N-Pints's satisfaction.</strong></p>

                of Service and any other restrictions stipulated to you by us in writing. Our registration process will ask you for information including your name and other personal and business information (including information regarding any licensing
                and registration applicable to you where you provide the Services). You must complete this and other processes to access any funds that you accept through the Services. In registering for an Account, you agree to provide true, accurate,
                current and complete information about yourself as prompted by the Services' registration process and as requested from time to time by Pizza-N-Pints (such information, "Registration Data"). You further agree that, in providing such Registration
                Data, you will not knowingly omit or misrepresent any material facts or information and that you will promptly enter corrected or updated Registration Data via the Services, or otherwise advise us promptly in writing of any changes or

                confusing or potentially violates the rights of a third party (such as when a trademark owner provides notice that an Account ID is similar to the trademark and the Account ID does not closely relate to the User's actual name or trademark
                rights).
            </p>
            <h3>Your Account</h3>

                the confidentiality of your Account IDs and for any charges, damages, liabilities or losses incurred or suffered as a result of your failure to do so. We are not liable for any harm caused by or related to the theft of your Account IDs,
                your disclosure of your Account IDs, or your authorization to allow another person to access or use the Services using your Account IDs. Furthermore, you are solely and entirely responsible for any and all activities that occur under your
                Account including any charges incurred relating to the Services. You agree to immediately notify us of any unauthorized use of your Account or any other breach of security known to you. You acknowledge that the complete privacy of your

            <h3 class="mb-0">Payment Processing Services</h3>
            <h2 class="mt-0">Pizza-N-Pints's Role</h2>
            <p>The Services allow Clients to pay and Professionals to accept payments, including Card-based payments initiated with Cards bearing the trademarks of MasterCard International Inc. and Visa Inc. (collectively, the "Networks"). We are not a bank
                and we do not offer banking services.</p>
            <p>Pizza-N-Pints facilitates the processing of payments Professionals receive from Clients. This means that we collect, analyze and relay information generated in connection with these payments.</p>
            <h2>Authorization</h2>
            <p>Professionals authorize us to hold, receive, and disburse funds on your behalf. Your authorization permits us to generate a paper draft or an electronic funds transfer to process each payment transaction that you authorize. Your authorizations
                will remain in full force and effect until your Account is closed or terminated.</p>
            <h2>Third Party Payment Service Provider</h2>
            <p>Users will be required to provide their credit card or bank account details to the Company and the Payment Service Provider retained by Pizza-N-Pints (the "PSP"), which may include Stripe. As a condition of Pizza-N-Pints enabling payment processing services
                through the PSP, you agree to provide Pizza-N-Pints accurate and complete information about you and your business, and you authorize Pizza-N-Pints to share it and transaction information related to your use of the PSP services.</p>
            <p>Professionals may be required to register with the PSP, agree to a PSP Account Agreement and the Terms of Service of the PSP and go through a vetting process at the request of the PSP to set up their account with the PSP. Please note that
                the Company is not a party to the PSP Agreement and that you, the PSP and any other parties listed in the PSP Agreement are the parties to the PSP Agreement and that the Company has no obligations or liability to any Professional under
                the PSP Agreement.</p>
            <p>When the PSP is Stripe, you are subject to the Stripe Connected Account Agreement, which includes the Stripe Terms of Service (collectively, the âStripe Services Agreementâ). By agreeing to these terms or continuing to operate as a Professional
                on Pizza-N-Pints, you agree to be bound by the Stripe Services Agreement, as the same may be modified by Stripe from time to time. As a condition of Pizza-N-Pints enabling payment processing services through Stripe, you agree to provide Pizza-N-Pints accurate
                and complete information about you and your business, and you authorize Pizza-N-Pints to share it and transaction information related to your use of the payment processing services provided by Stripe.</p>
            <p>Company reserves the right, in its sole discretion (but not the obligation), to (i) place on hold any payments from the Client for Styling Services and out of pocket expenses, or (ii) refund, provide credits or arrange for the PSP to do so.</p>
            <h2>Unauthorized or Illegal Use</h2>
            <p>We may (i) decide not to authorize or settle any transaction that you submit to us, (ii) refund a payment, or (iii) terminate your Account if we believe in our sole discretion that the transaction and/or your Account is in violation of these
                Terms of Service or any other Pizza-N-Pints agreement, or that it exposes Professionals, other Pizza-N-Pints Users, the PSP or Pizza-N-Pints to harm. Harm includes, but is not limited to, fraud and other criminal acts, as determined by Pizza-N-Pints in its sole discretion.
                If we reasonably suspect that your Account has been used for an unauthorized, illegal, or criminal purpose, you give us express authorization to share information about you, your Account, and any of your transactions with law enforcement.
                We may also request information (including, but not limited to, information about services rendered, identity verification and copies of applicable professional licenses) from you at any time for any reason or no reason as part of internal
                ongoing reviews of transactions and accounts on our Services, and in particular, to assist in investigations of suspicious transactions and/or accounts.Â  You hereby agree to provide us with such information and assistance in a timely manner
                and acknowledge that payment processing in connection with a suspicious transaction and/or account may be delayed until such transaction and/or account has been cleared by Pizza-N-Pints, in its sole discretion.Â  If you do not comply with Pizza-N-Pintsâs
                request for information and assistance pursuant to this Section (xv), Pizza-N-Pints reserves the right to prohibit you from processing any additional payments through the Services until you have provided such requested information and assistance

                only process Cards that receive an authorization from the applicable Network and Card issuer. You understand that there may be times when the Client may not be the authorized user of the Card or that such Client may otherwise contest the
                transaction through the Chargeback process (described below). You agree to comply with the Chargeback process and to liability associated with such Chargebacks.</p>
            <h2>Network Rules that Apply</h2>
            <p>The Networks require that you and Pizza-N-Pints comply with all applicable bylaws, rules, and regulations ("Network Rules"). The Networks amend their rules and regulations from time to time. Pizza-N-Pints may be required to change these Terms of Service
                in connection with amendments to the Network Rules. Significant portions of the Network Rules are available to the public atÂ <a href="www.visa.com">www.visa.com</a>,Â <a href="www.mastercard.com">www.mastercard.com</a>, andÂ <a href="www.americanexpress.com">www.americanexpress.com</a>.</p>
            <p>Network Rules currently prohibit you from dispensing cash on any Card transaction. The Rules also restrict your ability to assess a surcharge or split a single transaction in to multiple transactions except in certain limited situations.</p>
            <p>Your use of Network logos is governed by the Rules; you agree to familiarize yourself with and to comply with these requirements.</p>

                withholding, reporting, and remitting correct Taxes to the appropriate tax authority. We are not obligated to, nor will we determine whether Taxes apply, or calculate, collect, report, or remit any Taxes to any tax authority arising from

            </p>
            <p>If in a given calendar year your payments through the Services meet the state taxing authority thresholds for required reporting, Pizza-N-Pints will report your User Tax Information annually to the skatÂ  or other governing authority, as required
                by law. If Pizza-N-Pints receives a notification from the skatÂ  at any time that your User Tax Information is incomplete or inaccurate, Pizza-N-Pints will notify you immediately that you need to provide a complete Tax Information and reserves the right
                to (i) prohibit you from processing any additional payments through the Services and (ii) defer delivery of any earned payouts, until you have provided and Pizza-N-Pints has confirmed receipt of updated accurate User Tax Information. If Pizza-N-Pints
                does not receive such updated accurate User Tax Information within thirty (30) days of your receipt of Pizza-N-Pintsâs request for updated User Tax Information, Pizza-N-Pints will deduct any applicable fees owed to Pizza-N-Pints and will refund all undelivered
                earned payouts back to the applicable Client.</p>
            <p>Pizza-N-Pints disclaims any and all liability related to such refunded payouts. âUser Tax Informationâ means any information required to be provided to the , skat which includes but is not limited to the following: your name, address, Tax Identification
                Number (such as a CVR nr, the totalÂ  amount of the payments you receive in a calendar year, and the totalÂ  amount of the payments you receive for each month in a calendar year. Whether you meet the skat thresholds for required reporting

            <h2>Refunds and Returns.</h2>
            <p>By accepting payment Card transactions with Pizza-N-Pints, you agree to process returns of, and provide refunds and adjustments for, your goods or services through your Account in accordance with these Terms of Service and Network Rules. Network
                Rules require that you will (a) maintain a fair return, cancellation or adjustment policy; (b) disclose your return or cancellation policy to Clients at the time of purchase, (c) not give cash refunds to a Client in connection with a Card
                sale, unless required by law, and (d) not accept cash or any other item of value for preparing a Card sale refund. The amount of the refund/adjustment must include any associated taxes required to be refunded and cannot exceed the amount
                shown as the total on the original sales data except by the exact amount required to reimburse the Client for postage that the Client paid to return merchandise. If you accept returns and are making an uneven exchange of merchandise (e.g.,
                the sales price is not the same), you must issue a credit for the total amount of the merchandise being returned and complete a new sale for any new merchandise. Please be aware, if your refund policy prohibits returns or is unsatisfactory
                to the Client, you may still receive a Chargeback relating to such sales.</p>
            <p>You can process a refund through your Account up to sixty (60) days from the day you accepted the payment. If your available Pizza-N-Pints balance is insufficient to cover the refund, Pizza-N-Pints will request your authorization to withdraw up to the requested
                refund amount from your bank account or debit card. Pizza-N-Pints will then withdraw the amount you were paid (the sale amount minus the initial transaction fee) from your bank account or debit card, and credit it back into your Client's Card.
                The fees are also refunded by Pizza-N-Pints, so the full purchase amount is always returned to your Client. Pizza-N-Pints has no obligation to accept any returns of any of your goods or services on your behalf.</p>
            <h2>Liability for Chargebacks and Fraudulent Actions</h2>
            <p>The amount of a transaction may be reversed or charged back to your Account (a "Chargeback") if the transaction (a) is disputed, (b) is reversed for any reason by the Network, our processor, or a Client or our financial institution, (c) was
                not authorized or we have any reason to believe that the transaction was not authorized, (d) is allegedly unlawful, suspicious, or in violation of the terms of these Terms of Service.</p>
            <p>Pizza-N-Pints is not liable for any losses relating to Chargebacks, fraudulent charges, or other actions by any User that are deceptive, fraudulent or otherwise invalid as determined in Pizza-N-Pints's sole discretion ("Fraudulent Actions"). By using the
                Services, you hereby release Pizza-N-Pints from any liability arising from Fraudulent Actions. You will also use best efforts to promptly notify Pizza-N-Pints of any Fraudulent Actions which may affect the Services. Pizza-N-Pints reserves the right, in its
                sole discretion, to terminate the account of any User that engages in, or enables any other User to engage in, Fraudulent Actions.</p>
            <h2>Pizza-N-Pints Collection Rights for Chargebacks</h2>
            <p>For any transaction that results in a Chargeback, we may withhold the Chargeback amount in a Reserve. We may debit the amount of any Chargeback and any associated fees, fines, or penalties listed in the Fee Schedule or assessed by the Association
                or our processor from your Account (including without limitation any Reserve), any proceeds due to you, your bank account or debit card, or other payment instrument registered with us. If you have pending Chargebacks, we may delay payouts
                from your Account. Further, if we reasonably believe that a Chargeback is likely with respect to any transaction, we may withhold the amount of the potential Chargeback from payments otherwise due to you under these Terms of Service until
                such time that: (a) a Chargeback is assessed due to a Client's complaint, in which case we will retain the funds; (b) the period of time under applicable law or regulation by which the Client may dispute that the transaction has expired;
                or (c) we determine that a Chargeback on the transaction will not occur. If we are unable to recover funds related to a Chargeback for which you are liable, you will pay us the full amount of the Chargeback immediately upon demand. You
                agree to pay all costs and expenses, including without limitation attorneys' fees and other legal expenses, incurred by or on behalf of us in connection with the collection of all Account deficit balances unpaid by you.</p>
            <h2>Excessive Chargebacks</h2>
            <p>If we determine that you are incurring an excessive amount of Chargebacks, we may establish controls or conditions governing your Account, including without limitation, by (a) establishing new processing fees, (b) creating a Reserve in an
                amount reasonably determined by us to cover anticipated Chargebacks and related fees, (c) delaying payouts, and (d) terminating or suspending the Services.</p>
            <h2>Contesting Chargebacks</h2>
            <p>You agree to assist us when requested, at your expense, to investigate any of your transactions processed through the Services. To that end, you permit us to share information about a Chargeback with the Client, the Client's financial institution,
                and your financial institution in order to investigate and/or mediate a Chargeback. We will request necessary information from you to contest the Chargeback. If the Chargeback is contested successfully, we will release the reserved funds
                to your Account. If a Chargeback dispute is not resolved in your favor by the Network or issuing bank or you choose not to contest the Chargeback, we may recover the Chargeback amount and any associated fees as described in these Terms
                of Service. You acknowledge that your failure to assist us in a timely manner when investigating a transaction, including providing necessary documentation within five (5) days of our request, may result in an irreversible Chargeback.
                We reserve the right, upon notice to you, to charge a fee for mediating and/or investigating Chargeback disputes.</p>
            <h2>Pizza-N-Pints Set-off Rights</h2>
            <p>You grant us a security interest in, as well as a right of setoff against, and hereby assign, convey, deliver, pledge and transfer to us, as security for repayment of any obligations due under these Terms of Service, all of your right, title,
                and interest in and to all of your accounts with us. However, this grant will not apply to any accounts for which the grant of a security interest would be prohibited by law. You authorize us, without prior notice to you and irrespective
                of (i) whether we have made demand under these Terms of Service or any other related agreements; and (ii) whether the obligation is contingent, matured or unmatured, to the extent permitted by law, to collect, charge, and/or setoff all
                sums owing on the indebtedness against any and all such accounts and other obligations, and our option, to administratively freeze or direct any third party bank holding the account to freeze all such accounts to allow us to protect our
                security interest, collection, charge and setoff rights as provided for in this section.</p>
            <p>To the extent permitted by law, we may set off against the balances for any obligation you owe us under these Terms of Service, including without limitation any Chargebacks. All fees are charged at the time we process a transaction and are
                deducted first from the transferred or collected funds and thereafter from the balance in your Account. If you owe us an amount that exceeds your balance, we may charge or debit a payment instrument registered in your Account or any connected
                Account (as well as set off against any balance in any connected Account). Your failure to fully pay amounts that you owe us on demand will be a breach of these Terms of Service. You will be liable for our costs associated with collection
                in addition to the amount owed, including without limitation attorneys' fees and expenses, collection agency fees, and any applicable interest.</p>
            <h2>Inactive Accounts</h2>
            <p>If there is no activity in your Account (including access or payment transactions) for at least two years, consecutively, and you have a balance, we will notify you by sending an email to the email address associated with your Account and
                give you the option of keeping your Account open and maintaining the balance, withdrawing the balance, or requesting a check. If you do not respond to our notice within thirty days, we will automatically close your Account and escheat
                your funds in accordance with applicable law, and if permitted, to Pizza-N-Pints.</p>
            <h2>Processing Errors</h2>
            <p>We will attempt to rectify processing errors that we discover. If the error resulted in your receipt of less than the amount to which you were entitled, Pizza-N-Pints will credit your Account for the difference. If the error results in your receipt
                of more than the amount to which you were entitled, Pizza-N-Pints will debit the extra funds from your Account. Pizza-N-Pints will only correct transactions that you process incorrectly if and when you notify us of such an error. Your failure to notify
                us of a processing error within thirty days of when it first appears on your electronic transaction history will be deemed a waiver of any right to amounts owed to you.</p>
